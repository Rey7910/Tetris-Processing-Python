# Tetris with processing python module

This is a version of the classic tetris game developed with the python module for processing. Feel free to modify and improve it.

## Requirements

 - Python processing library,download and install [here][1] 
 - Java 7 or higher

## Usage
Find the source code  in the repository master branch, depending on your OS. Then the source code must be directly in the Processing IDE in the python module. 

## Game instructions
As soon as you compile and run the sketch the game will start, take this into account. The current tetris tile can be moved using the **a** key to move left and **d** key to move right. For rotating the tile use the **s** key. Capitals letters are also supported, hence **A** and **D** for moving and **S** for rotating is a valid movement.

If a piece gets to the top of the screen bound then you loose the game. When this happens a message will be shown on screen, with your final score.
