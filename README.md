# Tetris with processing python module

This is a version of the classic tetris game developed with the python module for processing. Feel free to modify and improve it.

## Requirements

 - Python processing library,download and install [here][1] 
 - Java 7 or higher

## Usage
Find the source code  in the repository master branch. Then the source code must be runed directly in the Processing IDE in the python module. There shoul not be any issue with the OS you are using, running the code directly in the IDE makes the game cross platform.

## Game instructions
As soon as you compile and run the sketch the game will start, take this into account. The current tetris tile can be moved using the **a** key to move left and **d** key to move right. For rotating the tile use the **w** key. Capitals letters are also supported, hence **A** and **D** for moving and **S** for rotating is a valid movement. You may move a tile directly to the bottom by pressing the **s** key.

Each time you delete a row you will get one point in your score. If a piece gets to the top of the screen bound then you loose the game. When this happens a message will be shown on screen, with your final score.
